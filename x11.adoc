[[x11]]
= X11

Only tested successfully in `x86_64`.

Build:

....
./build -x
./run
....

We don't build X11 by default because it takes a considerable amount of
time (~20%), and is not expected to be used by most users: you need to
pass the `-x` flag to enable it.

Inside QEMU:

....
startx
....

Not sure how well that graphics stack represents real systems, but if it
does it would be a good way to understand how it works.

[[x11-arm]]
== X11 ARM

On ARM, `startx` hangs at a message:

....
vgaarb: this pci device is not a vga device
....

and nothing shows on the screen, and:

....
grep EE /var/log/Xorg.0.log
....

says:

....
(EE) Failed to load module "modesetting" (module does not exist, 0)
....

A friend told me this but I haven't tried it yet:

* `xf86-video-modesetting` is likely the missing ingredient, but it does
not seem possible to activate it from Buildroot currently without
patching things.
* `xf86-video-fbdev` should work as well, but we need to make sure fbdev
is enabled, and maybe add some line to the `Xorg.conf`
