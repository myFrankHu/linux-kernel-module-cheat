= Other architectures

The portability of the kernel and toolchains is amazing: change an
option and most things magically work on completely different hardware.

[[arm]]
== arm

First build:

....
./build -a arm
./run -a arm
....

Debug:

....
./run -a arm -d
# On another terminal.
./rungdb -a arm
....

TODOs:

* only managed to run in the terminal interface (but weirdly a blank
QEMU window is still opened)
* GDB not connecting to KGDB. Possibly linked to `-serial stdio`. See

[[aarch64]]
== aarch64

....
./build -a aarch64
....

TODOs:

* GDB gives a ton of messages:
+
....
no module object found for ''
....
+
when you connect. `Ctrl + C` then `c` works though.
* How to add devices to `-M virt` as we did for `-M versatilepb`

[[mips64]]
== mips64

....
./build -a mips64
....
