[[record-and-replay]]
= Record and replay

QEMU supports deterministic record and replay by saving external inputs,
which would be awesome to understand the kernel, as you would be able to
examine a single run as many times as you would like.

Unfortunately it is not working in the current QEMU:

Alternatively, https://github.com/mozilla/rr[`mozilla/rr`] claims it is
able to run QEMU: but using it would require you to step through QEMU
code itself. Likely doable, but do you really want to?
