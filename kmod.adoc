[[kmod]]
= kmod

Multi-call executable that implements: `lsmod`, `insmod`, `rmmod`, and
other tools on desktop distros such as Ubuntu 16.04, where e.g.:

....
ls -l /bin/lsmod
....

gives:

....
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 4 Jul 25 15:35 /bin/lsmod -> kmod
....

and:

....
dpkg -l | grep -Ei
....

contains:

....
ii  kmod                                        22-1ubuntu5                                         amd64        tools for managing Linux kernel modules
....

BusyBox also implements its own version of those executables. There are
some differences.

Buildroot also has a kmod package, but we are not using it since
BusyBox' version is good enough so far.

This page will only describe features that differ from kmod to the
BusyBox implementation.
